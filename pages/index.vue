					Welcome to the demo of sentc for nuxt
				</v-card-title>
				<v-card-text>
					<p>We are using nuxt 2 with vuetify and the newest version of sentc.</p>

					<p>
						Sentc is a encryption sdk which provides end-to-end encryption, user identity and authentication
						and much more out of the box with a few lines of code.

						State of the art encryption and best practice user management.
					</p>

					<p>
						Create a new user account on sign up btn in the right corner or login with a user account.

						When you are logged in you can create and manage groups, or invite more user to your group.

						Have fun to explore our features.
